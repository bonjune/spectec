# Wasm SpecTec

Defines and implements a domain specific language (DSL) for the formal specification of Wasm.
The goal is to have a unified source that is simple to

* _read_, _write_, and code-review (simpler than Latex anyway),

* _check_ for first-level consistency,

* _process_ to generate other formats from.

Because this DSL can transport sufficient domain knowledge, various artifacts could be generated through dedicated backends:

* the _Latex_ for the formal specification for the spec document,

* the _prose_ specification pseudo-algorithms for the spec document,

* the _Coq_ and _Isabelle_ definitions for mechanisation,

* a reference _interpreter_, or parts thereof,

* a _test suite_ exercising individual rules.

Every such backend may need occasional extra guidance, so the language also includes generic syntax for uninterpreted hint annotations that each backend can hook into.


## Structure

The language consists of few generic concepts:

* _Syntax definitions_, describing the grammar of the input language or auxiliary constructs.
  These are essentially type definitions for the object language.
  For example:
  ```
  syntax valtype = | I32 | I64 | F32 | F64
  syntax functype = valtype* -> valtype*
  syntax instr = | NOP | BLOCK instr* | LOOP instr* | IF instr* ELSE instr*
  syntax context = { FUNC functype*, LABEL (valtype*)* }
  syntax config = state; instr*
  ```

* _Variable declarations_, ascribing the syntactic class (i.e., type) that meta variables used in rules range over.
  For example:
  ```
  var t : valtype
  var ft : functype
  var `C : context
  ```
  (Also, every type name is implicitly usable as a variable of the respective type.)

* _Relation declarations_, defining the shape of judgement forms, such as typing or reduction relations. These are essentially type declarations for the meta language. For example:
  ```
  relation Instr_ok: context |- instr : functype
  relation Step: config ~> config
  ```

* _Rule definitions_, expressing the individual rules defining relations. For example:
  ```
  rule Instr_ok/nop:
    `C |- NOP : epsilon -> epsilon

  rule Instr_ok/if:
    `C |- IF instr_1* ELSE instr_2* : t_1* -> t_2
    -- InstrSeq_ok: `C, LABEL t_2* |- instr_1* : t_1* -> t_2*
    -- InstrSeq_ok: `C, LABEL t_2* |- instr_2* : t_1* -> t_2*

  rule Step/nop:
    z; NOP ~> z; epsilon

  rule Step/if-true:
    z; (I32.CONST c) (IF instr_1* ELSE instr_2*) ~> z; (BLOCK instr_1*)
    -- iff: c =/= 0
  rule Step/if-false:
    z; (I32.CONST c) (IF instr_1* ELSE instr_2*) ~> z; (BLOCK instr_2*)
    -- iff: c = 0
  ```
  Every rule is named, so that it can be referenced.
  Each premise is introduced by a dash and includes the name of the relation it is referencing, easing checking and processing.

* _Auxiliary Functions_, allowing to abstract complex conditions into separate definitions.
  For example:
  ```
  def $size(numtype) : nat
  def $size(I32) = 32
  def $size(I64) = 64
  def $size(F32) = 32
  def $size(F64) = 64
  ```

Larger examples can be found in the [`spec` subdirectory](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec/tree/main/spectec/spec).


## Syntax

### Lists

```
list(x, sep) ::=
  epsilon
  x
  x sep list(x, sep)
```

### Literals

```
nat ::= digit+
text ::= """ utf8* """
```


### Identifiers and Atoms

```
digit ::= "0" | ... | "9"
upletter ::= "A" | ... | "Z"
loletter ::= "a" | ... | "z"

nat ::= digit+

upid ::= (upletter | "_") (upletter | digit | "_" | "." | "'")*
loid ::= (loletter | "`") (loletter | digit | "_" | "'")*
id ::= upid | loid

atomid ::= upid
varid ::= loid
defid ::= id
relid ::= id
ruleid ::= id

atom ::=
  atomid
  "_|_"

relop ::=
  ":" | ";" | "<:"
  "|-" | "-|"
  "->" | "~>"| "=>"
  "`." | ".." | "..."
```


### Types

```
typ ::=
  varid                                type name
  atom                                 custom token
  "bool"                               booleans
  "nat"                                natural numbers
  "text"                               text strings
  "epsilon"                            the empty phrase
  typ typ                              sequencing
  typ iter                             iteration
  "(" list(typ, ",") ")"               parentheses or tupling
  relop typ                            custom operator
  typ relop typ
  "`" "(" list(typ, ",") ")"           custom brackets
  "`" "[" list(typ, ",") "]"
  "`" "{" list(typ, ",") "}"

iter ::=
  "?"                                  optional
  "*"                                  list
  "+"                                  non-empty list
  "^" arith                            list of specific length
```

Custom atoms, operators and brackets are uninterpreted by the DSL semantics itself and can be used to define symbolic syntax for language or relations.
(Currently, most operators are binary, with hard-coded "natural" precedences. But these should be sufficient to emulate the kind of mixfix notation used for most relations.)

The various meta notations for lists, records, and tuples mirror the syntactic conventions defined in the Wasm spec.

Arithmetic expressions are a subset of general expressions, but with different parsing and interpretation of `+`, `*`, and `^` operators.
To use arithmetic operators in a place that is not naturally arithmetic, the subexpression must be escaped as `$( ... )`.


### Definitions

```
def ::=
  "syntax" varid hint* "=" deftyp                             syntax definition
  "relation" relid hint* ":" typ                              relation declaration
  "rule" relid (("/" | "-") ruleid)* ":" exp ("--" premise)*  rule
  "var" varid ":" typ hint*                                   variable declaration
  "def" "$" defid exp? ":" typ hint*                          function declaration
  "def" "$" defid exp? "=" exp                                function clause

deftyp ::=
  typ                                                         typ alias
  "{" list(atom typ hint*, ",") "}"                           records
  "|" list(varid | atom typ hint*, "|")                       variant

premise ::=
  relid ":" exp                                               relational premise
  "iff" ":" exp                                               side condition
  "otherwise"                                                 fallback side condition
  "(" relid ":" exp ")" iter                                  iterated relational premise
  "(" "iff" ":" exp ")" iter                                  iterated side condition

hint ::=
  "(" "hint" hintid exp ")"                                   hint
```

Variable declarations can also change the status of an uppercase identifier from `atom` to `varid`.


### Scripts

```
script ::=
  def*
```


## Status

Currently, the implementation consists of merely the frontend, which performs:

* parsing,
* type checking,
* multiplicity checking,
* recursion analysis.


## Building and Running

* You will need `ocaml` and `ocamlbuild` installed.

* Go to `src` directory, and invoke `make` to build the executable.

* In the same place, invoke `make test` to run it on the demo files from the `spec` directory.
